# Physics-25

Private collection of Jupyter notebooks (personal research snapshots).

Layout
- notebooks/<year>/ — dated notebooks (one notebook per file; keep a date in the filename).
- .gitignore — ignore editor/OS artifacts.
- requirements.txt — optional dependencies.

Minimal workflow
- Download → edit → save as new filename with updated date  upload.
- Use GitHub web or GitHub Desktop for simple uploads.

Notes
- This repo is private for single-researcher use. No CI or collaboration tooling by default.
- If you need reproducibility, add a `requirements.txt` or `envs/environment.yml` later.
